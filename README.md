This is a social network analyzer designed to analyze small social networks, recommend potential new friends, and provide various analytics features. 
Users input a file containing social network data, and the program validates the consistency of friendships in the network. 
It employs classes like DataEntry, Member, and Analytics to create a network representation, form common friendships, 
and offer analytics options such as displaying the number of friends, showing members with the least friends, and revealing direct and indirect relationships. 
The program runs iteratively, allowing users to input different files or 'n' to exit.
The readme provides clear instructions on running the application, highlights the dependency on the numpy library, 
and encourages users to explore and enhance the functionality of the Social Network Analyzer.
This code showcases the usage of OOP programming and reading from files.
The files included are example files that are used for the code.
